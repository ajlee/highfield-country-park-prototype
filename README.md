## ABOUT

This project is created by Alex Lee for Highfield Country Park in Levenshulme, UK. This is just a prototype in HTML to get feedback from users before building this in a CMS.

This is a work in progress and still needs improvements!

## METHOD

The prototype is built in SCSS, Twig and JS, and uses Bootstrap and JQuery. To install the required libraries this use `yarn install` and then use `gulp vendor` to add these libraries to appropriate project folder. To publish the site, run `gulp publish` to output the site to the `/publish` folder.

This will be hosted at bitballoon shortly which is a html hosting site, and handles forms via their own API when appropriate markup is added.
