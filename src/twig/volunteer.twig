                <h1>Volunteer</h1>
                  <p>Friends of Highfield Country Park are looking to create regular volunteering sessions. There are committed individuals who are already helping on their own, but we would like to organise times for people to help out together to create a more social and communal activities! There are lots of ways that you can help:</p>
                    <p>
                      <span>- bulb planting</span><br/>
                      <span>- litter picking</span><br/>
                      <span>- weeding</span><br/>
                      <span>- building bird boxes</span><br/>
                      <span>- maintaining the paths</span><br/>
                    </p>
                    <p>These are just a few examples... and there are also many admin jobs you can help with, for example, setting up and maintaining a shared files repository (like Google Docs), fundraising, running events, and publicity... so if you have a desire to help then fill in the form below! You can also join us for meetings every two months to get involved and talk to other members. Experience, skills and talent are optional!</p>
