                        <p class="body-content">Recently we have had a series of awful cold snaps, bringing snow and ice. However, this has not affecting the bird and pond life. Sightings over the last few months have included nightingales, singing their beautful songs. There is now a heron that can be sometimes seen on the park. Bullfinches and goldfinches can be seen too. The success of the birds may be in part due to the diverse trees. Some trees such as the cypress due to the way they trap air, can be 6c-9c warmer than the air temperature. We have also seen freshwater shrimp in the ponds - a sign of healthy clean water.</p>
                        <p class="body-content">Many thanks too for all who put out nuts and seeds on the park for the birds to keep them fed over the cold period. This made a massive difference!</p>

                          <p> In 2017 we held an event for the community to build bat boxes and to help children and adults alike connect to nature in the park. In a future session we will put up the bat boxes around the park and people will be able to see them around the park for years to come! The bats in the park are at risk and we are doing what we can to support them. See below for photos. </p>

                        <p class="body-content">The Friends of Highfield Country Park are bidding for funds to create a bee sanctuary in the park. Our idea is to create a Bee sanctuary garden in Highfield, one that all can enjoy and use as a walk through, and a place to sit and soak up the sun in the beautiful garden. A place where people can be educated and become closer to nature, but most of all for the bees of Manchester! As we all know, our bees need help, and it is vital that we help protect them. The aim is to have as many fruit trees, flowers, plants herbs and grasses that bees can flourish in, whilst creating an elegant space for families and other wildlife to enjoy. There would be a trail, which includes facts about bees, their different species, how they protect us and how we can help protect them. <a href="https://www.avivacommunityfund.co.uk/voting/project/view/17-3871">Read more and vote for us on the Aviva website!</a></p>

                        <p class="body-content">Plans were submitted by Towerhouse Systems to propose developing 57 houses on Cringle Road by Highfield Country Park. This would have covered the land where the Shores Fold Community Farm currently stands. </p>

                        <p>Reasons given for the council rejecting this development included:
                          <ul>
                            <li><strong>Lack of access </strong> :- since it is assumed that each household may have two cars each, 114 cars may have to use Cringle Road for access. The roads were not considered big enough to cope with this.</li>
                            <li><strong>Shores Fold Community Farm </strong> :- the farm is unique to this area, allowing families to visit and get tours of the animals. The loss of this farm would mean children would not get a chance to learn about animals.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bat population </strong>:- bats have been confirmed to be living in Highfield Country Park and are a protected species. The loss of farmland would have an detrimental impact on their numbers. Now that this has been confirmed, we hope to do more work to support the bats.</li>
                          </ul>

                          For more information on this planning application see the documents at <a href="http://pa.manchester.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&keyVal=OQK6U8BCLRJ00">the Manchester Council website</a>.
