                        <p class="body-content">Plans were submitted by Towerhouse Systems to propose developing 57 houses on Cringle Road by Highfield Country Park. This would have covered the land where the Shores Fold Community Farm currently stands. </p>

                        <p>Reasons given for the council rejecting this development included:
                          <ul>
                            <li><strong>Lack of access </strong> :- since it is assumed that each household may have two cars each, 114 cars may have to use Cringle Road for access. The roads were not considered big enough to cope with this.</li>
                            <li><strong>Shores Fold Community Farm </strong> :- the farm is unique to this area, allowing families to visit and get tours of the animals. The loss of this farm would mean children would not get a chance to learn about animals.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bat population </strong>:- bats have been confirmed to be living in Highfield Country Park and are a protected species. The loss of farmland would have an detrimental impact on their numbers. Now that this has been confirmed, we hope to do more work to support the bats.</li>
                          </ul>

                          For more information on this planning application see the documents at <a href="http://pa.manchester.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&keyVal=OQK6U8BCLRJ00">the Manchester Council website</a>.

                        <p class="body-content">Volunteers Peter and Steve put in a new bench by the pond just by Nelstrop Road. This Tolkien-esque pond looks wild enough to make you think you may find crocodiles inside! And now there is a place for you to relax here, with a new bench that is in place. The new bins have been put in by the picnic area by Bowler St, by St Andrews, and on the path along by Cringle Road.</p>
